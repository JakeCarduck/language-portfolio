# language-portfolio

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to highlight my skill in various computer science languages, offering a look at my level of knowledge in the areas.  

I hope this portfolio can both serve as a minor refresher for my knowledge of the languages, as well as provide potential employers a look at what I know, and likely
when I last dealt with a language or tool. This should hopefully help better understand my skill set. For example, one computer science course I took at VCU taught me
the C programming language, but I haven't used it since. If I was told in a technical interview to write in C, I would likely struggle if not outright fail. However,
if I was given a day to write a simple program in C, I would be able to quickly re-learn/remember the skills by perusing the Internet, and thus be able to complete
the C program.  
I also hope this portfolio can help me re-learn the paradigms and use-cases for various languages. Although I likely know the concepts and aspects of various languages
in my subconscious, if asked "what are the four pillars are" I would likely struggle, since I was taught them in one or two courses, but never actually have to proclaim
or assert them directly; so while I may use them, or even be able to come up with what they roughly are, I don't have them committed to memory. I hope this portfolio
will help me learn them deeply so I can confidently answer interview questions when asked about them.  

## Languages
I hope to implement programs that hopefully have SOME kind of actual usage. My plan for the languages (which will be updated as I go) is:
* HTML/CSS - Webpage design for explaining my programs as well as talking about the languages (such as the paradigms and pillars of languages and their concepts).
* Python - Project 1: Make a webscraping program that pulls various info about books I am reading off the Internet so I can keep up-to-date about them.
* SQL - Project 1: Store the information scraped and manually inputted; be able to query it through a GUI.
* JavaScript/TypeScript - Project 1: Work in tandem with HTML/CSS to provide a GUI for searching my stored book records.
* Java - TBD; maybe use it for cleaning and adjusting data, and analyzing scraped data to ensure it is valid, though this might just be done in Python.
* C - TBD; maybe I will use the threads in order to allow the program to re-scrape data (using Python program) from multipe sites at once when updating records?
